# Skynet Node

This directory contains the implementation of a Skynet Node and provides an API for interacting with the Skynet network. The Skynet GUI is built on top of this API.

By default, the Skynet Node will run on port 3001. You can change this by setting the `HTTP_PORT` environment variable.
